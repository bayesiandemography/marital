#' Census data on population counts by age, sex, and marital status,
#' for 1990, 2000, and 2010. The marital statuses are 
#' "Single", "Married", "Divorced", and "Widowed".
#' The maximum age group is 60+.
#'
#' We created the dataset by combining data obtained from two
#' UN online database. One database had counts by age and sex,
#' for all ages, and the other had counts by age, sex,
#' and marital status for ages 15+. The totals for age and sex
#' from the second database were slightly lower than those from
#' the first in 2000 and 2010. We have scaled the counts
#' from the second database to match those from the first.
